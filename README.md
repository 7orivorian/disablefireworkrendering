# Disable Firework Rendering
## About
This is a simple mod to disable
fireworks rendering, used to stop lag fireworks from
crashing the client.  
This is lazy and could be done better, but Minecraft works in strange ways with the spawning of entitys, easier to just
block them off completely.  
The lag is not simple caused by the particles, it's just from the sheer amount of laggy entities.  
To renable fireworks rendering, do `/togglefireworks`
